# Hi there!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer at Indorse/Metalinq which is an all-remote blockchain / web3 based engineering company that is working on building critical infrastructure that will enable interoperability of assets across multiple metaverses/ecosystems. You can read our [Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP-5606)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5606).

I previously worked at a startup called Remedico and built the [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.remedicoapp) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/remedico/id1478936836) apps from scratch using React Native. I have also worked on a lot of core features for Remedico's customer facing [web application](https://remedicohealth.com) along with a lot of doctor facing improvements and applications.

I have also worked for Accenture's [myWizard](https://www.accenture.com/in-en/services/applied-intelligence/mywizard-intelligent-automation-platform) in the past which is an intelligence tools based automation platform.

I graduated from PES University (then called PESIT) in 2017 as an Electronics & Communications Engineer.
