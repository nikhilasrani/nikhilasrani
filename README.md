### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Frontend Engineer focused on crafting delightful and engaging user experiences leveraging ES6+ JavaScript and other modern tools of web development.

I primarily work with React, Node and React Native and I have dabbled with GraphQL, TypeScript, Vue.js and Svelte on my personal projects.
